# whats_my_password

This is a full stack application called what's my password. It is designed so that a person can store their passwords of websites and user names.

This application allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their credentials.


#General Approach

The backend was built using Ruby on Rails,  I have set up the routes, controllers, and models. I am using Postgress SQL as a database. In the front end I have set up Ajax to communicate with rails.
